### My first NFT Project

- The project is made through [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)(An Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development).
- I have used OpenZeppelin contracts to make ERC-721 contracts.
- I have used [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/)(Blockchain Node Provider) to send the smart contract on the ethereum node.
- The application is deployed on **Goerli Network**
